Twitter Embed
Twitter Embed is a simple card that displays a single tweet from Twitter. 
It includes the user's avatar, name, username, the tweet itself, the total number of likes, and the date it was published. 
The design is intended to be easily integrated into other websites and provides a way for users to view and interact with a tweet without leaving the page they are on. 
The design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to quickly and easily access the content they are interested in.

How to Start
To begin the challenge, you will first need to download the design file from the provided link. 
This will give you access to all of the necessary design elements and assets that you will need to complete the challenge.

Next, take some time to study the design and understand how it works. 
Look at the layout, color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic to get a sense of the look and feel of the design.

After you have a good understanding of the design, you can start exporting all of the necessary assets. 
This may include images, fonts, and other elements that you will need to use in your code.

Finally, it's time to start implementing the design into code! Use your exported assets and the design file as a reference as you work to create a functional and visually appealing implementation of the design.
